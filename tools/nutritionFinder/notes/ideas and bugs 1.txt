BUGS-ISH:

as of 29MAR22 compare data is tied to nutrient-tab current data


BUG 29MAR22: related search creates more fetch requests as one clicks the related function more (i.e. first related search = 1 fetch; second related search = 2 fetch; third related search = 3 fetch; 4th = 9; 5th = ~19 )
 more info: createSimilarSearch() creates event listener which calls showRelatedSearch(); showRelatedSearch() calls createSimilarSearch
 immediate solution: remove "create" methods from showRelatedSearches()


BUG 29MAR22: status 500 from server
 potential cause: too long a query string

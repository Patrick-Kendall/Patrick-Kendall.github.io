        <h1>The Idiot</h1>
        <h3>Fyodor Dostoevsky (1868-1869)</h3>
        <h4 class="first">About the Author</h4>
        <p>Dostoevsky triumphs in the portayal of humans as flawed and proud creatures, with only transient awareness of our lesser qualities; if one achieves self awareness at all. His books contain such crucial
            lessons in humility that I feel <i>Crime and Punishment</i> should be part of the high-school curriculum.</p>
        <p>Dostoevsky was a Russian man who trained as an engineer and then quickly became a writer. He was arrested by the Russian state for political crimes and subjected to a mock execution and four years of forced labor. </p>
        <p style="padding-bottom:6px;"><b>Influenced by:</b> Pushkin, Poe, Cervantes, Hugo, Gogol, Kant, and many others </p>
        <p style="padding-top:0;"><b>Influenced:</b> Nietsche, Einstein, Hemingway, and many others </p>
        <h4 class="first">Briefest Summary of the Work</h4>
        <p>Peculiar masterpiece by the man who wrote <i>Crime and Punishment</i> </p>
        <h4 class="first">Brief Summary of the Work</h4>
        <p>The novel story of an epileptic, Russian prince named Lef Nikolayevich Myshkin who stumbles first through other's romantic pursuits, then pursues his own perplexing romances. The prince is seen as an idealist and is frequently dismissed by others as an idiot. At the same time, every character sees the prince as a force, with strong perceptive abilities, and a persistent good will which they admire and are confused by.</p>
        <p>The prince pursues an unpredictable woman named Nastasia Filippovna. Nastasia and the prince are two of a kind; they see the world as it is. They process the world in different ways; her through suspicion or dismissiveness, him through acceptance or submission. Conversely, she has acts of faith facing certain harm and he reacts with disbelief and resoluteness where the painless course of action is obvious. The inconsistency in the main character's actions is a major source of criticism for the work. </p>
        <p> The ancillary characters often play ironic roles, where their actions conflict with their professed opinions. </p>

        <h4 class="first">My Take</h4>
        <p>Most analyses of this book portray it as a Christ story, with the idiot's kind-hearted behavior compared to the Messiah's love for mankind. Though this theme is present, it is not the primary message. The primary message from this book is that one can never assume to know other people's motivations.</p>
        <p>The bizarre style in which the book is written forwards my point of view. The plot has sudden sharp turns in which characters. the main character, the idiot, constantly has motivations projected onto him, only to confuse everyone by acting on what seems to be an inner philosophy, based, yes, on Christ's commandment: love one another.</p>
        <h4 style="color: green">Difficulty: Easy; bizarre style</h4>

        <h4 class="first">My Take</h4>
        <p>The book covers the other war of 1812: Napoleon's invasion of Russia. Interestingly, the book discusses women's rights and the abolition of slavery, called serfdom in Russia.

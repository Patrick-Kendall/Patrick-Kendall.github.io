        <h1>The Idiot</h1>
        <h3 class="author">Fyodor Dostoevsky (1868-1869)</h3>
        <h4 style="color: green;">Difficulty: Easy; bizarre style</h4>
        <h4 class="first">About the Author</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Dostoevsky triumphs in the portayal of humans as flawed and proud creatures, with only transient awareness of our lesser qualities, if one achieves self awareness at all. His books contain such crucial
            lessons in humility that I feel <i>Crime and Punishment</i> should be part of the high-school curriculum.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Dostoevsky was a Russian man who trained as an engineer and then quickly became a writer. He was arrested by the Russian state for political crimes and subjected to a mock execution and four years of forced labor. </p>
        <p class="first-paragraph"><b>Influenced by:</b> Pushkin, Poe, Cervantes, Hugo, Gogol, Kant, and many others </p>
        <p class="paragraph"><b>Influenced:</b> Nietsche, Einstein, Hemingway, and many others </p>
        <h4 class="first">Briefest Summary of the Work</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">Peculiar masterpiece by the man who wrote <i>Crime and Punishment</i> </p>
        <!-- =========================================================== -->

        <h4 class="first">Brief Summary of the Work</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;A novel story of an epileptic, Russian prince named Lef Nikolayevich Myshkin who stumbles first through other's romantic pursuits, then pursues his own perplexing romances. The prince is seen as an idealist and is frequently dismissed by others as an idiot. At the same time, every character sees the prince as a force, with strong perceptive abilities, and a persistent good will which they admire and are confused by.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"> &emsp; &emsp;The prince pursues an unpredictable woman named Nastasia Filippovna. Nastasia and the prince are two of a kind; they see the world as it is. They process the world in different ways; her through suspicion or dismissiveness, him through acceptance or submission. Conversely, she has acts of faith facing certain harm and he reacts with disbelief and resoluteness where the painless course of action is obvious. The inconsistency in the main character's actions is a major source of criticism for the work. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;The ancillary characters often play ironic roles, where their actions conflict with their professed opinions. </p>
        <!-- =========================================================== -->

        <h4 class="first">My Take</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Most analyses of this book portray it as a Christ story, with the idiot's kind-hearted behavior compared to the Messiah's love for mankind. Though this theme is present, it is not the primary message. The primary message from this book is that one can never assume to know other people's motivations.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;The bizarre style in which the book is written forwards my point of view. </p>

        <h1>War and Peace</h1>
        <h3 class="author">Leo Tolstoy (1865)</h3>
        <h4 style="color: #f56c42">Difficulty: Moderate; very long</h4>
        <h4 class="first">About the Author</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Tolstoy was born into an aristocratic Russian family and owned serfs. He fought in the Crimean War. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Tolstoy's philosophy is complicated. He was a Christian and a pacifist. He was also anti-church and anti-government, to the point that some refer to him as an anarchist. Tolstoy was excommunicated by the Russian Orthodox church late in his life. Yet, he was an enthusiatic Christian. </p>
        <p class="first-paragraph"><b>Influenced by:</b> Schopenhauer, Proudhon, Hugo </p>
        <p class="paragraph"><b>Influenced:</b> Gandhi, Lenin, Hemingway </p>
        <h4 class="first">Briefest Summary of the Work</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Philosophical masterpiece; discusses everything from war strategy to religious doubts to a unique portrayal of existentialism. </p>
        <!-- =========================================================== -->

        <h4 class="first">Brief Summary of the Work</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Pierre Bezukhov is the main character. Pierre is the illegimate son of a rich count and has been well educated abroad. Pierre begins the story as an atheist. He falls into a large amount of money and marries a gorgeous but wicked woman named Helene. Helene is rumored to be having an affair and Pierre challenges the man to a duel against his better judgement. He wounds the man and leaves Helene. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Around this time Pierre meets with his friend Prince Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky, another major character of the book. Bolkonsky is married to a delightful, small woman named Lisa. He is dissatified with their relationship and ends up leaving her pregnant with his father to join the army. He joins the army in preparation for the 1805 Battle of Austerlitz, in which Napoleon acheives a heroic victory against a larger Austrian and Russian army. A treaty is signed and Austria cedes much of its territory to France. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Pierre and Bolkonsky meet after Bolkonsky is wounded and captured by the French. Bolkonsky is returned home to find his wife dying in childbirth. At their meeting Pierre and Bolkonsky have a discussion about freeing the serfs they own. Pierre insists on freeing the serfs as a matter of principle, based on his Freemason beliefs. Bolkonsky is more empathetic, stating: "you want to make him what I am, without giving him my means." In the end Pierre does not succeed in freeing his serfs, while Bolkonsky frees a few hundred and provides them a means to sustain themselves. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;The plot continues with Pierre taking Helene back. Bolkonsky visits St. Petersburg and meets Natasha Rostova. Natasha, her brother Nikolai, and the Rostov family are the other major storyline. The Rostovs are a rich family whose finances are in bad shape due to mismanagement and Nikolai's gambling. Bolkonsky proposes to Natasha, but his father objects and delays the marriage. Natasha then breaks their engagement after being seduced by Helene's brother. The brother is previously married to a woman he abandoned in Poland. When Natasha learns of this, she attempts suicide. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;A French army marches through Russia and threatens to reach Bolkonsky's father's residence. Nikolai Rostov rescues Bolkonsky's sister after Bolkonsky's father passes away. The book then focuses on Napoleon, his army and his lieutenants. As the French approach Moscow, Pierre raises a militia and joins the Russian army. The 1812 Battle of Borodino is a climactic moment in the book. The Russian army stands up to the invincible French army and both sides receive heavy casualties. The Russians end up withdrawing, giving the French an indecisive victory.  </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;The Russian army retreats through Moscow to the countryside. The French army follows and occupies Moscow. Moscow burns to the ground. It is unknown how the fires are started. Bolkonsky is badly wounded during the battle. The Rostovs escape Moscow with carts full of wounded soldiers instead of their belongings. Pierre remains in Moscow and decides to assassinate Napoleon. He instead fights with looting French soldiers and is arrested. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;The French army is forced to retreat and takes Pierre with it. The retreat from Moscow in the middle of winter was a disaster; starvation, disease and desertion annihilated the French army. Pierre befriends a peasant, Platon Karataev, in captivity. Platon is then shot by the French. Pierre's philisophic musings come to a head during the retreat. Pierre is rescued by Russian soldiers led by the man who he wounded in his duel. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Bolkonsky is among the wounded soldiers carted off by the Rostovs. He sees Natasha, forgives her for breaking their engagement, and then dies. Pierre's wife Helene dies of an overdose. Pierre and Natasha then rekindle a romance from earlier and get married. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;In two epilogues, the story is wrapped up, with Nikolai Rostov marrying Bolkonsky's sister and resolving his family's debts. The second epilogue is a philosophical discussion. Tolstoy indicates that all actions are to degrees a combination of free-will and necessity. He challenges the notion that history is written by great individuals; instead suggesting that much of those person's actions are dictated by thousands of small events and necessity. While only a small portion is due to the free will of the individual.  </p>
        <!-- =========================================================== -->

        <h4 class="first">My Take</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;The book covers the other war of 1812: Napoleon's invasion of Russia. Interestingly, the book discusses women's rights and the abolition of slavery, called serfdom in Russia. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;The story in this book is excellent. However, the philosophy which is present throughout the book is what makes it legendary. At its best, the philosophy is discussed casually and makes powerful statements about Russian society and the nature of human relationships. At its worst, the imagery is difficult to understand and is longer than is enjoyable to read. Even so, the book is always well written. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Pierre's struggles with his faith play a big role in this book. They set the stage for the highly philisophical later chapters. One notable moment comes when Pierre first encounters a Freemason. Pierre suggests his disbelief in God and says his way of looking at world is opposed to that of the Masons. The Mason responds: </p>
        <p class="quotation">"I know your outlook, and the view of life you mention, and which you think is the result of your own mental efforts, is the one held by the majority of people, and is the invariable fruit of pride, indolence, and ignorance. Forgive me, my dear sir, but if I had not known it I should not have addressed you. Your view of life is a regrettable delusion."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Even aside from the brutal slam at the end, there is a lot to unpack in this quote. The "outlook" discussed is simply Pierre's Atheism. Suggesting it is not the result of his mental efforts and is in fact the outlook held by a majority of people strikes me as insightful. The idea that God exists is alien to our human existence and perhap against logic; so it seems that Atheism must be the conclusion many people honestly hold when forced to confront the issue. This takes away the novelty and the assumed intellectual superiority one sometimes faces when discussing religion with Atheists. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Tolstoy suggests in his other epic work, <i>Anna Karenina</i>, that students of what was then called the "natural sciences," which we now simply call science, were unjustly dismissed as nihilists. It seems that Tolstoy suggests something similar about followers of religion. Religious people may be unjustly dismissed as unreasonable, when in fact the issue is so obvious, that to assume they have not realized the alien nature of the existence of God is in fact the error. Between Atheism, Agnostisism and religion, it is a matter of choice, and of little consequence, unless one believes in eternal damnation that is. </p>

        <h1>Anna Karenina</h1>
        <h3 class="author">Leo Tolstoy (1875-1877)</h3>
        <h4 style="color: green">Difficulty: Easy; very long</h4>
        <h4 class="first">About the Author</h4>

        <h4 class="first">Briefest Summary of the Work</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Two simultaneous romantic masterpieces with commentary on the good life, and indescribable scenes  </p>
        <!-- =========================================================== -->

        <h4 class="first">Brief Summary of the Work</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;The novel follows two storylines; one centered around Konstantin Dmitrievich Levin, and a second which switches its focus between Alexei Vronsky and Anna Karenina. </p>
        <p></p>
        <!-- =========================================================== -->
        
        <h4 class="first">My Take</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;This book is phenomenal. It is rightly considered the greatest book of all time. If you do not have the time to read the book, I have heard the movie is also excellent. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;What makes this book, and Tolstoy's work, so special, is the precise, psychological description of small characters and then the scenes which play out with those characters. Small characters, such as the portraitist who paints Anna in Italy, are used to send powerful messages about, in that case Vronsky, and also about human nature. This is accomplished in a short amount of writing, then the character disappears. </p>

        <h1>The House of the Dead</h1>
        <h3 class="author">Fyodor Dostoevsky (1860-1862)</h3>
        <h4 style="color: green;">Difficulty: Easy; more a collection of short stories than a novel</h4>
        <h4 class="first">Briefest Summary of the Work</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Tales and characters from Dostoevsky's time in a prison labor camp </p>
        <h4 class="first">My Take</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;The work is eye-opening, gut-wrenching and cruel in its truthfulness. Yet, somehow Dostoevsky retains a light-hearted narration. You emerge from a Dostoevsky work more man than you were going in, regardless of your gender. You also emerge with more empathy; often more empathy for the poor and the sick. One may also gain empathy for the cruel, deranged and the dangerous; as they are often sick or poor as well. </p>

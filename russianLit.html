        <p>About the Author</p>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;Dostoevsky was a Russian man who trained as an engineer and then quickly became a writer. He was arrested by the Russian state for political crimes and subjected to a mock execution, four years of forced labor, and compulsory military service. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;Dostoevsky triumphs in the portrayal of humans as flawed and proud creatures, with only transient awareness of our lesser qualities. His books contain such crucial lessons in humility that I feel <i>Crime and Punishment</i> should be part of the high-school curriculum.</p>

        <p>Briefest Summary of the Work</p>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp; The novel story of a Russian prince. The prince is seen as an idealist and is frequently dismissed by others as an idiot. At the same time, every character sees the prince as a force, with strong perceptive abilities, and a persistent good will which they admire and are confused by. </p>
        </div>

        <p>Brief Summary - INCOMPLETE</p>

        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;The prince arrives in Russia after spending his young life abroad receiving treatment for epilepsy. Myshkin takes a train back to Russia. The prince is seated next to a man named Rogojin. Rogojin is a main character who is obsessed with Nastasia Filippovna. The prince's first stop in Russia is a distant relative's house whom he has never met. He is met by General Epanchin, his relative's husband. General Epanchin views the prince as a beggar, but is quickly won over by the prince's candidness and simple charm. The general provides the prince with a place to live in his secretary Gania's household. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;Gania is a frequent character in the book. He participates in a scheme with the general to marry Nastasia Filippovna in exchange for 10,000 rubles. Nastasia is in fact the most beautiful woman any of them have ever seen and is well educated. Gania is receiving 10,000 rubles to marry her because she is causing so much trouble for her benefactor, Totsky. Totsky takes an interest in the orphan peasant, Nastasia, while she is only a child due to her great beauty. He molests her as a child, and has her raised in one of his country houses by a private tutor. When Nastasia grows up, she travels to St. Petersburg to torment and humiliate Totsky for several years. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;The prince leaves the general to meet with his relative: Lizabetha Prokofyevna. Lizabetha is an ironic matron in a marriage struck by adultery. The prince charms Lizabetha by saying she is like a child, a trait they both see as virtuous. He also charms her three daughters with stories of his time abroad. He creates an impression by telling the story of a time he saw a prisoner being executed. Aglaya is a main character late in the book. The prince charms Aglaya and her mother by saying of Aglaya:  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="quotation"><p class="discussion-text">She is so beautiful one is afraid to look at her.</div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;The prince does not say this with intent to charm, but as a statement of fact in response to a question. Before leaving, the prince passes notes between Gania and one of the daughters, Aglaya Epanchin. Aglaya rejects Gania as she is revolted by his inability to choose her over Nastasia without a promise by her to choose him. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;Gania brings the prince to his home. Here the prince meets Nastasia. She comes to Gania's home because they are due to become engaged that evening. She meets Gania's mother and sister who disapprove of Gania marrying in exchange for money. They also view Nastasia as a "fallen woman." Rogojin and a band of drunks barge into the house and Rogojin offers Nastasia 100,000 rubles to marry him. The offer is not refused and everyone leaves to prepare for a meeting at Nastasia's residence that evening. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;The prince shows up at this meeting uninvited, to the delight of Nastasia. Nastasia is acting erratically.  They play games which make everyone uncomfortable, most of all Totsky and the general. The moment of announcing Gania and Nastasia's bethrothal arrives. Nastasia asks the prince if she should marry Gania. He emphatically answers no and so she refuses Gania. Rogojin and his band of drunks, now more drunk than before, barge in again. Rogojin drops 100,000 on the floor and asks Nastasia to marry him. The prince objects and offers to marry Nastasia himself. The prince produces a letter stating he will inherit a large fortune. Nastasia wants to marry the prince but refuses. She accepts Rogojin's offer and tosses the money into the fire. She says Gania can have it if he fetches it with his bare hands. Gania refuses and faints. She fetches the money and bequeaths it to Gania then leaves with Rogojin. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;This is the end of the second part of the book. The third and fourth parts of the book are written in a unique way which can be difficult to follow. There is some narration before the book resumes. The narrator says that the prince pursues Nastasia and Rogojin to Moscow. Nastasia runs away from Rogojin to the prince, then runs away from the prince to Rogojin. Gania returns the 100,000 rubles to Nastasia. The Epanchin family travels to a suburb for the summer.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;The prince gives two abominable speeches, breaks a vase, and has an epileptic seizure. After this, Aglaya and Lizabetha firmly decide Aglaya cannot marry the prince.  </p>

        <div class="myTake-header"><p>My Take - INCOMPLETE </p><a name="myTakeTheIdiot" class="take-anch"></a></div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;Most literary analyses of this book describe the prince as a manifestation of Christ's love. They focus on the notion that the prince is meant to be a "completely beautiful human being" as Dostoevsky wrote in a letter. Some of the book's characters even cast the prince as a Christ figure. However, critics are too focused on symbolism and consistency to appreciate the message of this Dostoevsky work. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;The prince is a device to reveal how susceptible we are to pre-judgement and how easily our opinions may be swayed. The prince is used as a foil to more cynical characters; he assumes the best about others and forgives as a matter of course. Contrived situations show generosity, tolerance and forgiveness leading to the best result. In this way the prince resembles and confirms the ideal of Christ. However, that is only a small piece of the book.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;The true message can be seen by the size of its presence in the book. Throughout the book, characters act on whims and act ironically. One can be sincerely wrong and still be a worthwhile person. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;The message has to do with people's motivations and sincerity. From the first interactions between Myshkin and the Epanchins, people assign motives to the Prince. Throughout the book, characters act on whims and act ironically. One cannot assume to know another person's motivations. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;Dostoevsky reveals only partial information in almost all cases in the book. He uses suggestion instead of statements to reveal characters intentions and actions. This is seen as more similar to real life than a normal novel. Character's motivations are always a mystery. Dostoevsky often makes a point to force a character to choose an absurd action. This is the most consistent thing about the book. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;Throughout the book, Dostoevsky is making one point. He is making an exagerrated point about the </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;One cannot know another's motivations as that person cannot know them themselves. Motivations, ideas are temporary, subject to whim. This can be seen in every character and best observed in Nastasia. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;The most intriguing moments in the novel are when the Prince goes back on his word or apparently lies. For instance, when he visits Nastasia's home after telling Rogojin he would not do so. Or when he tells Mrs. Epanchin his letter to Aglaya was written "as to a sister." </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;One quote from Lebedeff expresses the message:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="quotation">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;"Words and actions, truth and falsehood, are all jumbled up together in me, and yet I am perfectly sincere." (322)
        </div>
        <div class="quotation"><p class="discussion-text">You have confused your motives and ideas (321)</div>
        <div class="quotation"><p class="discussion-text">perhaps she had her reasons for doing so (309)</div>
        <div class="quotation"><p class="discussion-text"> What did you know of my intentions? (280)</div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;In a critical sense, the book does have flaws. The plot flops a bit at the end of the third part. Much of the last fifty pages is admittedly unpleasant to read. 9

            However, the book is endlessly insightful. It contains the best of tragedy and comedy while somehow being neither. It is an exagerrated, more interesting form of real life, with commentary from one of the greatest authors of all time. </p>

        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;Philosophical masterpiece; discusses everything from war strategy to religious doubts to a unique portrayal of existentialism. </p>

        <p>Brief Summary</p>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;Pierre Bezukhov is the main character. Pierre is the son of a rich count and is well educated abroad. Pierre begins the story as an atheist. He falls into a large amount of money and marries a gorgeous but wicked woman named H&eacutel&egravene. H&eacutel&egravene is rumored to be having an affair and Pierre challenges the man to a duel against his better judgement. He wounds the man and leaves H&eacutel&egravene. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;Around this time Pierre meets with his friend Prince Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky, another major character in the book. Bolkonsky is married to a delightful, small woman named Lisa. He is dissatified with their relationship and ends up leaving her pregnant with his father to join the army. He joins the army in preparation for the 1805 Battle of Austerlitz, in which Napoleon acheives a heroic victory against a larger Austrian and Russian army. A treaty is signed and Austria cedes much of its territory to France. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;Bolkonsky is wounded and captured by the French. He returns home to find his wife dying in childbirth. He then meets with Pierre and discusses freeing the serfs they own. Pierre insists on freeing and educating the serfs as a matter of principle, based on his Freemason beliefs. Bolkonsky is more empathetic, pointing at a serf and stating: "you want to make him what I am, without giving him my means." In the end Pierre does not succeed in freeing his serfs, while Bolkonsky frees a few hundred and provides them a means to sustain themselves. This is characteristic of the two characters. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;The plot continues with Pierre taking H&eacutel&egravene back. Bolkonsky visits St. Petersburg and meets Natasha Rostova. Natasha, her brother Nikolai, and the Rostov family are the other major storyline. The Rostovs are a rich family whose finances are in bad shape due to mismanagement and the son's gambling. Bolkonsky proposes to Natasha, but his father objects and delays the marriage. Natasha then breaks their engagement after being seduced by H&eacutel&egravene's brother. The brother is previously married to a woman he abandoned in Poland. When Natasha learns of this, she attempts suicide. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;A French army marches into Russia and threatens to reach the Bolkonsky estate. Nikolai Rostov rescues Bolkonsky's sister after her father passes away. The book then focuses on Napoleon, his army, and his lieutenants. As the French approach Moscow, Pierre raises a militia and joins the Russian army; Bolkonsky again serves as an officer. The 1812 Battle of Borodino is a climactic moment. The Russian army stands up to the invincible French and both sides receive heavy casualties. The Russians end up withdrawing, giving the French an indecisive victory.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;The Russian army retreats through Moscow to the countryside. The French army follows and occupies Moscow. At some point, Moscow burns to the ground. It is unknown whether the French or Russians started the fires. The Rostov family escape Moscow with carts full of wounded soldiers instead of their belongings. Pierre remains in Moscow and decides to assassinate Napoleon. He instead fights with looting French soldiers and is arrested. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;The French army is forced to retreat and takes Pierre with it. The retreat from Moscow in the middle of winter is a disaster; starvation, disease and desertion annihilate the French army. Pierre befriends a peasant, Platon Karataev, in captivity. Platon is then shot by the French. Pierre's philosophical musings come to a head during the retreat. Pierre is rescued by Russian soldiers led by the man he wounded in his duel. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;Bolkonsky is among the wounded soldiers carted off by the Rostovs. He sees Natasha, forgives her for breaking their engagement, and then dies. Pierre's wife H&eacutel&egravene dies of an overdose. Pierre and Natasha rekindle a romance from earlier and get married. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;In the first of two epilogues, the story is wrapped up, with Nikolai Rostov marrying Bolkonsky's sister and resolving his family's debts. The second epilogue is a philosophical discussion. Tolstoy indicates that all actions are to degrees a combination of free-will and necessity. He challenges the notion that history is written by great individuals, i.e. Napoleon; instead suggesting that much of those person's actions are dictated by thousands of small events and therefore necessity. While only a small portion is due to the free will of the individual. </p>
        </div>
        <!-- =========================================================== -->

        <div class="myTake-header"><p>My Take </p><a name="myTakeWarAndPeace" class="take-anch"></a></div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;This book covers the other war of 1812: Napoleon's invasion of Russia. Interestingly, the book discusses women's rights and the abolition of slavery, called serfdom in Russia. However, I would not recommend this book to many people.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;The story in this book is excellent. However, the philosophy is what makes it legendary. At its best, the philosophy is discussed casually and makes powerful statements about Russian society and the nature of human relationships. At its worst, the imagery is difficult to understand and is longer than is enjoyable to read. Even so, the book is always well written. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;Pierre's struggles with his faith play a big role in this book. They set the stage for the highly philosophical later chapters. One notable moment comes when Pierre first encounters a Freemason. Pierre suggests his disbelief in God and says his way of looking at the world is opposed to that of the Masons. The Mason responds: </p>
        </div>
        <div class="quotation">I know your outlook, and the view of life you mention, and which you think is the result of your own mental efforts, is the one held by the majority of people, and is the invariable fruit of pride, indolence, and ignorance . . . Your view of life is a regrettable delusion.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;Even aside from the brutal slam at the end, there is a lot to unpack in this quote. The "outlook" referenced is Pierre's atheism. Suggesting it is not the result of his mental efforts and is the outlook held by a majority of people strikes me as insightful. The idea that God exists is alien to our human existence and perhap against logic; so it seems that atheism must be the conclusion many people honestly hold when forced to confront the issue. This takes away the novelty and assumed intellectual superiority one faces when discussing religion with atheists. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;Tolstoy suggests in his other epic, <i>Anna Karenina</i>, that students of what was then called the "natural sciences," which we now simply call science, were unjustly dismissed as nihilists. Tolstoy suggests something similar about followers of religion. Religious people may be unjustly dismissed as unreasonable, when in fact assuming they have not realized the alien nature of the existence of God is the error. Between atheism, agnostisism and religion, it is a matter of choice, and of little consequence unless one believes in eternal damnation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;Another quote is revealing of Tolstoy's personality and his writing style:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="quotation">To Bolkonsky so many people appeared contemptible and insignificant creatures, and he so longed to find in someone the living ideal of a perfectly rational and virtuous man. Had Speransky sprung from the same class . . . Bolkonsky would soon have discovered his weak, human, unheroic sides.</div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;Speransky is a military officer Bolkonsky just met. Later in the book, he sees Speransky's weak, human side. </p>

        <p>Brief Summary</p>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;The novel follows two storylines: one centered around Konstantin Levin, and a second which switches its focus between Alexei Vronsky and Anna Karenina. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp; I will not summarize the book as it would be a large task. I recommend reading the book itself as it is an easy read. </p>

          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;This book is phenomenal. It is rightly considered the greatest book of all time. If you do not have the time to read the book, I have heard the movie is also excellent. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;What makes this book, and Tolstoy's work generally, so special is the precise, psychological description of small characters and then the scenes which play out with those characters. Small characters, such as the portraitist who paints Anna in Italy, are used to send messages about, in that case Vronsky, and also about human nature. This is accomplished in a short amount of writing, then the character disappears. </p>

          <h3 class="author">Fyodor Dostoevsky (1860-1862)</h3>

        <div style="color: green;">Difficulty: Easy; more a collection of short stories than a novel</div>
        <p>About the Author</p>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;Dostoevsky was a Russian man who trained as an engineer and then quickly became a writer. He was arrested by the Russian state for political crimes and subjected to a mock execution, four years of forced labor, and compulsory military service. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;Dostoevsky triumphs in the portrayal of humans as flawed and proud creatures, with only transient awareness of our lesser qualities. His books contain such crucial lessons in humility that I feel <i>Crime and Punishment</i> should be part of the high-school curriculum.</p>

          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;The work is eye-opening, gut-wrenching and cruel. Yet somehow Dostoevsky retains a light-hearted narration. One emerges from a Dostoevsky work more man than you were going in, regardless of your gender. One also emerges with more empathy, often more empathy for the poor and the sick. One may also gain empathy for the cruel, deranged and the dangerous; as they are often sick or poor as well. </p>

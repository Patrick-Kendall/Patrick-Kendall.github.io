        <h4 style="color: #A20;">Difficulty: Hard; short; lots of ancient history and Italian history</h4>

        <h4 class="first">About the Author</h4>
        <div class="first-paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;Machiavelli lives during the late 15th and early 16th centuries in Italy, which is not a pleasant time. Italy is broken into small kingdoms, many owned by foreign empires. The country is flooded with French troops and Spanish mercenaries. The pope controls a moderate-sized kingdom and engages in power struggles as viciously as anyone else. Handheld firearms are just beginning to play a decisive role in battle.</p>

        <div class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;The most famous political work ever; a history of principalities; instructional booklet for rulers of principalities </div>

        <h4>Major Points</h4>
        <div class="first-paragraph">
          <p class="premise-num">1. </p>
          <p class="premise-text"> One must look at the world as it is, not as it ought to be. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="premise-num">2.</p>
          <p class="premise-text"> Princes who lie, manipulate, and are capable of cruelty are more successful than those who rely on loyalty; it is better to be feared than loved.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="premise-num">3.</p>
          <p class="premise-text"> Continual, <i>impetuous</i> activity is key to maintaining a state, not the adherence to a strict moral code. Rulers must act when necessary, in the mode that is necessary, as severely as necessary. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="premise-num">4.</p>
          <p class="premise-text">The reputation of a prince is very important. His actions must be associated with "greatness, spiritedness, gravity and strength" , so that "no one thinks of deceiving or getting around him."</p>
        </div>

        <h4>Selected Additional Points</h4>
        <div class="first-paragraph">If one must commit evil, it is best to do it all at once instead of doling it out over a long period.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">When entering a disparate province, one should ally with lesser powers, weaken the major power, prevent foreign powers from entering, go to live there or build colonies there.

        <div class="quotation">whoever conspires cannot be alone, but cannot find company except from those he believes to be malcontents
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">Ministers of a prince are extremely important; ministers ought to think only of the prince, not themselves. Likewise the prince should think often of his ministers.

        <h4 class="myTake">My Take - The Prince <a name="myTakeThePrince" class="take-anch"></a></h4>
        <div class="first-paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;I would not recommend this book to many people; it is challenging to read and requires a certain, perverse outlook to enjoy. However, it is part of history and is highly influential to subsequent political leaders and scientists. The author's personality is good, not great. His lack of moral pretense is refreshing and sets the stage for empiricism, modern-science, and much good to come. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;<i>The Prince</i> is revolutionary in that Machiavelli does not shy away from the idea that a prince may need to commit atrocities, lie, and break promises; he even intructs the prince on when and how to do so effectively. This lends to the popular notion that Machiavelli is evil. One quote stands out:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="quotation">whoever becomes patron of a city accustomed to living free and does not destroy it, should expect to be destroyed by it
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;This is not so much an endorsement of the practice of destroying cities as it is a frank assessment of what one may expect. Looking at history, his assessment is correct. Alexander the Great utterly destroys Thebes, Greece after they revolt against him. This action stops Athens and Thebes from rebelling while Alexander conquers Asia. Machiavelli uses the many cities the Romans destroy as his examples, such as Carthage. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;  It is difficult to know what kind of person Machiavelli is, but from <i>The Prince</i> one can see that he is not a sadist; he is instead one with disdain for pretense and the people who act on pretense. </p>

        <h4 class="first">About the Author</h4>
        <div class="first-paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;Hobbes is unique among philosophers as his influential work, <i>Leviathan</i>, does not contain large analogies or premises which have been disproven by chemistry, physics, etc. He was in fact a noted scientist and may have befriended Galileo. He had a contentious, respectful relationship with Descartes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;Hobbes was a beneficiary of the rich Cavendish family. He spent much of his life in England. He spent a decade in France in exile during the English Civil War.

          <p class="premise-text"> There exists a "state of nature" where man has no property: you only own what you can hold, and only for as long as you can hold it. All disputes can be settled only through the sword. </p>

          <p class="premise-text"> The foundation of a commonwealth is based on "covenants." The sovereign power is exactly the terror described above. The sovereign power is judge over the commonwealth and replaces the sword in settling disputes.</p>

          <p class="premise-num"> 2.b</p>

          <p class="premise-num"> 3.c</p>
          <p class="premise-text"> Defines commonwealth as three forms: monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy; all other words used to describe government fall within these three forms. </p>

        <h4>Selected Additional Points</h4>
        <div class="first-paragraph"> Every serious conversation about the world must begin with clear definitions. </div>

        <div class="paragraph">Defines many words and phrases in the early part of the book which are worth reading. For instance: </div>
          <div class="quotation"> Ignorance of the signification of words; which is, want of understanding, disposeth men to take on trust, not only the truth they know not; but also the errors; and which is more, the nonsense of them they trust. </div>
          <div class="paragraph"> Insane people cannot be held to the standard of law because they cannot comprehend the law and therefore cannot agree to it </div>
        <div class="paragraph"> We owe fealty to the people who provide us sustenance. The mother is the person to whom a child owes fealty. The father is owed fealty only if he sustains the mother. </div>
        <div class="paragraph"> One state subjugating another is invariably a monarchy over the subjugated state, i.e. the Roman republic (a type of aristocracy) subjugating its provinces is a republic acting as a monarchy over the provinces. </div>
        <div class="paragraph"> Suggests the argument against monarchy is sophistical: suggesting that subjects of a monarchy are slaves is sophistical.</div>

        <h4 class="myTake">My Take - Leviathan <a name="myTakeLeviathan" class="take-anch"></a></h4>
        <div class="first-paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp; The first several chapters of <i>Leviathan</i> contain much more than political philosophy. One sees much of this book in modern-day law, science and cultural norms. In one work, Hobbes lays out much of the heavy lifting for the following centuries. For example, one quote from the book lays out a keen view of the nature of human knowledge: </p>
        </div>
        <div class="quotation">No discourse whatsoever can end in absolute knowledge of fact ... as for the knowledge of fact, it is originally sense, and ever after memory. ... it is not absolute, but conditional. No man can know by discourse that this, or that, is, has been, or will be; ... but only that if this be, that is; if this has been, that has been; if this shall be, that shall be; which is to know conditionally: and that not the consequence of one thing to another, but of one name of a thing to another name of the same thing.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;One who is familiar with Hume's 1748 <i>Enquiry</i> may see a troubling similarity between the quoted passage and Hume's division of knowledge into matters of fact and relation between ideas. Nevertheless, Hume's musings are more direct and perhaps more eloquently put. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;In terms of political philosophy, <i>Leviathan</i> is groundbreaking in that it begins the social contract theory. This theory is grounded in the idea that government and society is founded on the notion of a covenant or agreement between citizens. From this, all justice and law is developed; where law constitutes an agreement between all citizens. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;The enduring nature of Hobbes's work lies in his definition of "unjust." Justice is in most cases undefined. However, Hobbes provides a simple and consistent method of determing just behavior. Unjust is the breaking of a covenant; all else is just. This remains one pillar of US law. It sometimes creates controversy where no law is broken, but there is a severe ethical incursion. For example, the sub-prime mortgage crisis in 2008. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;Another topic which frequently appears in <i>Leviathan</i> is the notion of authority and trust. Hobbes continually warns: don't trust the "authority of books," don't trust the "authority of an Aristotle," don't trust the "authority and good opinion we have of him that hath said it." He suggests that there is a position below ignorance; he calls it: <i>"as much below the condition of ignorant men as men indued with true science are above it."</i> He is talking about those who believe something false because they gave authority to someone else, those who<i> "follow the blind blindly."</i> I feel that today science has become too complicated and the world too big to give authority to no one. Still, it is a valuable warning. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;I would recommend this book to someone who is looking for a serious study; taking notes or rereading is necessary as this is a dense book. However, at the end you will have gained a lot. As I said, there is much more than political philosophy in this book. I will admit that I did not read the second volume. The second volume contains Hobbes's interpretation of Scripture.</p>

          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;It has been said that Rousseau is one on a short list of authors which one needs to read in order to understand everything. Outside of modern science, I should say this is true. This book contains many ideas which remain cornerstones of American government. It also contains ideas which are neglected by our government yet seem better than what we have now. Among these are the ideas that government is inherently temporary and that all laws may be revoked. Today there is a sense that the laws which exist or are part of the U.S. Constitution, are permanent.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;Rousseau argues that pure democracy is the single valid form of government. He suggests a representative democracy, such as the U.S., is in fact a form of slavery. In the time between elections, citizens of the U.S. exist in a state of slavery; where voting and executive power are out of their hands. According to Rousseau, real democracy would have periodic meetings between all citizens. Meetings at which laws may be changed.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;During the second impeachment trial of President Trump, one senator Mcconnell suggested that the legislative did not have the authority to impeach a President post-presidency. This is nonsense as the legislative has absolute power; it could eliminate the executive branch altogether through amendment of the Constitution. According to Rousseau, the people can cast off the legislative branch if they wanted to. The lack of periodic assemblies as described by Rousseau is a critical failure of our current system. Rousseau suggests that a representative government, such as ours, is a form of slavery; in that we give up our sovereignty whenever we are not engaged in the act of voting.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;The idea of temporary nature of government brings up many issues. One has to choose if one believes more in democracy or equality. Modern-day Afghanistan illustrates this conflict. Afghanistan is a conservative, male-dominated society. Yet, since the removal of the Taliban, women have had their fair share of political power. It is conceivable that this country may face a reckoning with women's rights after the withdrawal of international soldiers.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;Considering they have a democratic system of government, it is conceivable that they will democratically attempt to remove from women their political power. Such is the conflict between true democracy and equality. Can a majority grant and remove rights from a minority based on gender or other distinction? Or do citizens not have absolute power over how to govern themselves?  </p>

        <div class="first-paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;Henry David Thoreau was a Massachusetts native who advocated living simply with nature. He is perhaps best known for writing <i>Walden</i>. He was a transcendentalist and therefore assigned the highest value to the individual. He expresses anti-government views in <i>Civil Disobedience</i>, but his views are not easily classified in today's political terms. He hated slavery, unjust war, and advocated protecting the environment. </p>

        <div class="first-paragraph">
          <p class="premise-num"> 1. </p>
          <p class="premise-text">The government is distinct from the general will and can be "abused and perverted" before the people can act through it.</p>

          <p class="premise-text">One who morally objects to the government must withdraw their support by not paying taxes and generally not recognizing the government. One quote adds to this premise:</p>

          <p class="premise-text">Government should have an alternative to living as part of the lawful society. One should be allowed to not follow the laws so long as one fulfills duties of "neighbors and fellow-men."</p>
        </div>

        <h4 class="myTake">My Take - Civil Disobedience<a name="myTakeCivilDis" class="take-anch"></a></h4>
        <div class="first-paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;Much of the first pages strike me as disagreeable or outdated. However, parts of this essay are enduring and beautiful. Thoreau is torn between living honestly or tacitly participating in slavery and war. Paying taxes is seen as participating in the actions of government. To avoid participating in evil, one must withdraw from the social-contract government one is born into. Thoreau goes so far as to advocate breaking the law whenever it requires you to do an injustice on another person. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;This is the enduring mandate given in the work. Subsequent civil disobedience has resulted in positive changes across the globe. The problem with Thoreau's justice is that it is fundamentally subjective. For example, one may feel that access to abortion is a civil or human right. However, another may feel that abortion is an "injustice" as defined by Thoreau. If the latter person follows Thoreau's mandate, to disobey the law and even "clog" the government with their full weight, the government may well grind to a halt. This halting is a consequence of an objection to settled law and a topic which is morally ambiguous, as are all topics. How then does the individual, as a "higher and independent power," reconcile a sincere difference in conscience between a majority and a minority? </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;One must go back to the Hobbesian notion of judging only by the sword, as was the case for slavery during the Civil War. Thoreau suggests that rule by the majority is simply rule by who is physically the strongest. He points out how law can be and is used to benefit a small group. One quote reveals his understanding and contempt for law: </p>
        </div>
        <div class="quotation">The lawyer's truth is not Truth, but consistency, or a consistent expediency. </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;Thoreau seems to believe in capital-t Truth and an objective form of justice; the idea which, for those of us who desire "expediency," is so troubling. However, he points out a real and persistent flaw in democracy: legislators may not represent the people and<i> undue respect for the law</i> can lead to horrific circumstances occurring and continuing. He argues the individual conscience must be allowed to prevail over the rule of law. This idea is not so objectionable. I only wish he did not assert his anti-government views so plainly. Especially because the solution he suggests lies not in the reframing of government, but in a change of human nature. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;I worry that this book's anti-government propositions may be used out of context to argue for the modern-day anti-government school of thought. Thoreau's sentiments clearly stem from a hatred of the practice of slavery. In context, Thoreau's work is commendable, necessary, but out of context it is powerful and ambiguous. He claims that he seeks a reason for paying his taxes every year and cannot justify it. Much of the current movement is not comparable to this, and modern-day motivations may even be abhorrent to Thoreau. His ideas may be employed by those who use other people's personalities to justify their own bad or selfish decisions.<p>

        <h4 class="first">About the Author</h4>
        <div class="first-paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;David Hume was a Scottish philosopher most notable for his work concerning the nature and origin of knowledge. Hume was also a historian and economist.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;Hume attended the University of Ediburgh at the age of twelve or ten and did not graduate. He spent much of his life writing. He pursued jobs at universities but was discriminated against due to his alleged atheism. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;I am obsessed with Hume. I particularly agree with his views on ethics in that ethics is a result of emotion or sentiment rather than a fundamental code.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="first-paragraph">
          <p class="inline-heading">Influenced by:</p>
          <p class="discussion-text">Macchiavelli, Hobbes, Descartes, Locke, and many others </p>

        <h4 class="first">Briefest Summary of the Work</h4>
        <div class="first-paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;Short essay about the origin of government and the origin of citizen's obedience to government</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Major Points</h4>
        <div class="first-paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;Hume argues that the concept of government founded solely on consent or agreement is incorrect. He points out that every government in history was founded based on "violence or false pretenses". This does not negate the idea of government founded on consent, but he points out that such a government has not been recorded.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;A sticking point in any conversation about social contracts is how consent is measured. Often, consent is considered tacit or undeclared by the people continuing to live in the country. Hume suggests that in order for tacit consent to exist the people must believe that their consent is required. Tacit consent also suggests that people have an alternative. In Europe, the language barrier and economic risks are insurmountable for the common person. These people have little choice than to continue to live under the government.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;Living under the government, they need to choose if they will obey the law. Hume sees obedience to the government as a moral question. He states that moral duties may be sorted into two categories. First, the duties which are "natural instinct" and "independent of all ideas of obligation" such as love of children. Second, the duties which are <i>necessary for society to operate</i> such as "regard to the property of others" and "observance of promises." Hume classes obedience to government in the second category. The reason for obedience then is that it is necessary for society to operate and not "because we should keep our word." </p>
        </div>
        <h4 class="myTake">My Take - Original Contract <a name="myTakeOriginalContract" class="take-anch"></a></h4>
        <div class="first-paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;As always, Hume applies a degree of nihilism to his subject. In pointing out the lack of historical precedent, he effectively pours cold water on those who suggest government by consent is the only lawful form of government. However, "because we should keep our word" seems like a bad-faith characterization of the reasoning behind original contracts.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;He bases his arguments on the notion that he can only "appeal to general opinion" for the correct conclusion. In this subjectivity, he lays himself open to error. He bases his criticism on what has come before and on general concensus. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;One cannot expect Hume to imagine the revolutionary U.S. Constitution and the dozens of democracies it inspires. However, by basing what is politically possible on what has come before, Hume reveals a critical flaw in pure empiricism. To Hume's credit, he acknowledges his argument as subjective. </p>

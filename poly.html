        <h1>The Prince</h1>
        <h3 class="author">Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli (1532)</h3>
        <h4 style="color: #A20;">Difficulty: Hard; short; lots of ancient history and Italian history</h4>
        <h4 class="first">About the Author</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Machiavelli was a senior official in the small Italian state: the Republic of Florence. He sought the unification of Italy and the expulsion of what he called barbarians: France, The Holy Roman Empire, and the like. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Machiavelli lived during the late 15th and early 16th centuries in Italy, which is not a pleasant time. Italy is broken into small kingdoms, many owned by foreign empires. The country is flooded with French troops and Spanish mercenaries. The papacy controls a moderate-sized kingdom and engages in power struggles as viciously as anyone else. Handheld firearms are just beginning to play a decisive role in battle.</p>
        <p class="first-paragraph"><b>Influenced by:</b> Plutarch, Aristotle, Plato, Dante, Da Vinci </p>
        <p class="paragraph"><b>Influenced:</b> Henry VIII, Bacon, Dumas, US Founding Fathers, many more </p>
        <h4 class="first">Briefest Summary of the Work</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;The most famous political work ever; a history of principalities; instructional booklet for rulers of principalities </p>
        <h4>Major Points</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">1.) One must look at the world as it is, not as it ought to be.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">2.) Princes who lie, manipulate, and are capable of cruelty are more successful than those who rely on loyalty; it is better to be feared than loved.
        <p class="paragraph">3.) Continual, "impetuous" activity is key to maintaining a state, not the adherence to a strict moral code. Rulers must act when necessary, in the mode that is necessary, as severely as necessary.
        <p class="paragraph">4.) The reputation of a prince is very important. His actions must be associated with "greatness, spiritedness, gravity and strength" , "no one thinks of deceiving or getting around him."
        <h4>Selected Additional Points</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">If one must commit evil, it is best to do it all at once instead of doling it out over a long period. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">When entering a disparate province, one should ally with lesser powers, weaken the major power, prevent foreign powers from entering, go to live there, or build colonies there. </p>
        <p class="quotation">whoever conspires cannot be alone, but cannot find company except from those he believes to be malcontents</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Ministers of a prince are extremely important; ministers ought to think only of the prince, not themselves. Likewise the prince should think often of his ministers.</p>

        <h4 class="myTake">My Take</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;I would not recommend this book to many people; it is challenging to read and requires a certain, perverse outlook to enjoy. However, it is part of history and is highly influential to subsequent political leaders and scientists. The author's personality is good, not great. His lack of moral pretense is refreshing and sets the stage for empiricism, modern-science, and much good to come. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;<i>The Prince</i> is revolutionary in that Machiavelli does not shy away from the idea that a prince may need to commit atrocities, lie, and break promises; he even intructs the prince on when and how to do so effectively. This lends to the popular notion that Machiavelli is evil. One quote stands out to me:</p>
        <p class="quotation">whoever becomes patron of a city accustomed to living free and does not destroy it, should expect to be destroyed by it</p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;This is not so much an endorsement of the practice of destroying cities as a frank assessment of what one may expect. Looking at history, his assessment is correct. Alexander the Great utterly destroys Thebes, Greece after they revolt against him. This action likely stops Athens and Thebes from rebelling while Alexander conquers Asia. Machiavelli uses the many cities the Romans destroy as his examples, such as Carthage. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;  It is difficult to know what kind of person Machiavelli is, but from <i>The Prince</i> one can see that he is not a sadist; he is instead one with disdain for pretense and the people who act on pretense. </p>

      <div class="review"><a name="Leviathan"></a>
        <h1>Leviathan - Volume 1</h1>
        <p class="myTake-link" style="float:right;"><a href="#myTakeLeviathan">My Take</a></p>
        <h3 class="author">Thomas Hobbes (1653)</h3>
        <h4 style="color: #A20">Difficulty: Hard; long</h4>
        <p>Available: <a target="_blank" href="https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/hobbes/Leviathan.pdf">online-pdf</a></p>
        <h4 class="first">About the Author</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Hobbes is unique among philosophers as his influential work, <i>Leviathan</i>, does not contain large analogies or premises which have been disproven by chemistry, physics, etc. He was in fact a noted scientist and may have befriended Galileo. He had a contentious, respectful relationship with Descartes. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Hobbes was a beneficiary of the rich Cavendish family. He spent much of his life in England. He spent a decade in France in exile during the English Civil War. For a thorough and readable discussion of Hobbes's philosophy I recommmend the <i> Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</i> <a target="_blank" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hobbes/">here</a>. </p>

        <p class="first-paragraph"><b>Influenced by:</b> Bacon, Galileo, Descartes, Machiavelli  </p>
        <p class="paragraph"><b>Influenced:</b> Hume, Locke  </p>
        <h4 class="first">Briefest Summary of the Work</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Renowned as the foundation of political science; a progressive work which broaches psychology, the nature of language, knowledge, and science </p>
        <h4>Major Points</h4>
          <p>Of the Nature of Man</p>
        <p class="paragraph"> 1.a) Suggests that men are close to equal in physical strength; men are more-closely equal mentally than physically</p>
        <p class="paragraph"> 1.b) Suggests "state of nature" where man has no property: you only own what you can hold, and only for as long as you can hold it. All disputes can be settled only through the sword. Below is perhaps the most famous quote from the book: </p>
          <p class="quotation">"the life of man, solitary, poor, brutish, and short" </p>
        <p class="paragraph"> 1.c) Suggests that doing to others as we would have done to us is against human nature and must be enforced by "terror of some power."
          <p>Of the Nature of Society</p>
        <p class="paragraph"> 2.a) Suggests the foundation of a commonwealth is based on "covenants". The sovereign power is exactly the terror described above. The sovereign power is judge over the commonwealth and replaces the sword in settling disputes.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"> 2.b) Defines unjust as solely the breaking of a "covenant." Anything which is not the breaking of a covenant is just. </p>
        <p class="paragraph"> 2.c) Suggests humans have an inalienable right of self preservation which cannot be given up. Promises proceeding from fear of death are not covenants.
        <p class="paragraph"> 2.d) A valid commonwealth is granted by free consent; dominion is granted by promise on fear of death or violence.
          <p>Of the Nature of Sovereign Government</p>
        <p class="paragraph"> 5.) Suggests a sovereign monarch or assembly is not bound by any covenant with the people; the sovereign cannot breach covenant with the people and cannot be dismissed on such grounds.
        <p class="paragraph"> 6.) Suggests government has the right to produce truth: regular instruction of the populace as to the truth and standard of law is beneficial to a society </p>

        <p class="paragraph"> 7.) Defines commonwealth as three forms: monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy; all other words used to describe government fall within these three forms. One state subjugating another is invariably a monarchy over the subjugated state i.e. the Roman republic (a type of aristocracy) subjugating its provinces is a republic acting as a monarchy over the provinces; </p>
        <h4>Selected Additional Points</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">Defines many words and phrases in the early part of the book which are worth reading. For instance: </p>
          <p class="quotation"> Ignorance of the signification of words; which is, want of understanding, disposeth men to take on trust, not only the truth they know not; but also the errors; and which is more, the nonsense of them they trust. </p>
        <p class="paragraph"> Suggests every serious conversation about the world must begin with clear definitions. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">  Argues that insane people cannot be held to the standard of law because they cannot comprehend the law and therefore cannot agree to it </p>
        <p class="paragraph"> Argues that we owe fealty to the people who provide us sustenance; argues that the mother is the person that a child owes fealty to due to providing sustenance; the father is owed fealty only if he sustains the mother </p>
        <p class="paragraph"> Argues for strong government; likely due to the turmoil in England at the time he lived.</p><a name="myTakeLeviathan"></a>
        <p class="paragraph"> Suggests the argument against monarchy is sophistical: suggesting that subjects of a monarchy are slaves is sophistical</p>
        <h4 class="myTake">My Take</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp; The first several chapters of <i>Leviathan</i> contain much more than political philosophy. One sees much of this book in modern-day law, science and cultural norms. In one work, Hobbes lays out much of the heavy lifting for several subjects. For example, one quote from the book lays out a keen view of the nature of human knowledge: </p>
        <p class="quotation">"No discourse whatsoever can end in absolute knowledge of fact (...) as for the knowledge of fact, it is originally sense, and ever after memory. (...) it is not absolute, but conditional. No man can know by discourse that this, or that, is, has been, or will be; (...) but only that if this be, that is; if this has been, that has been; if this shall be, that shall be; which is to know conditionally: and that not the consequence of one thing to another, but of one name of a thing to another name of the same thing."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;One who is familiar with Hume's <i>Enquiry</i> may see a troubling similarity between the quoted passage and Hume's division of knowledge into matters of fact and relation between ideas. Nevertheless, Hume's musings are more direct and perhaps more eloquently put. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;An interesting topic which frequently appears in <i>Leviathan</i> is the notion of authority. Hobbes continually warns: don't trust the "authority of books," don't trust the "authority of an Aristotle," don't trust the "authority and good opinion we have of him that hath said it." He suggests that there is a position below ignorance; he calls it: <i>"as much below the condition of ignorant men as men indued with true science are above it."</i> He is talking about those who believe something false because they gave authority to someone else, those who<i> "follow the blind blindly."</i> I feel that today science has become too complicated and the world too big to give authority to no one. Still, it is a valuable warning. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;In terms of political philosophy, <i>Leviathan</i> is groundbreaking in that it begins the social contract theory, in that government and society is founded on the notion of a covenant between citizens. From this, all justice and law is developed; where law constitutes an agreement between all citizens.
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;The enduring nature of Hobbes's work lies in his definition of "just" and "unjust." Justice in many cases is undefined. However, Hobbes provides a simple and consistent method of determing just behavior. Unjust is the breaking of a covenant, all else is just. This remains the foundation of US law. It sometimes creates controversy, where no law is broken, but there is a severe ethical incursion, for example, the sub-prime mortgage crisis in 2008. </p>

        <h4>Major Points</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph"> 1.) A monarch's power does not stem from Adam's paternal power and dominion over the Earth. </p>

        <p class="paragraph"> 6.) Humans are naturally inclined to form societies.</p>
        <h4 class="myTake">My Take</h4><a name="myTakeSecondTreatise"></a>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;An interesting distinction between Hobbes and Locke is the method at which they find mankind to be equal. Hobbes deduces man to be equal from an observation that any man can kill another, if not by brute force, then with cunning or superior numbers. Locke suggests humans being equal is self-evident, visible through a God-given ability to reason. This difference in method is characteristic of the difference between these two works. </p>

        <h1>Of The Original Contract</h1>
        <p class="myTake-link" style="float:right;"><a href="#myTakeOriginalContract">My Take</a></p>
        <h3 class="author">David Hume (1752)</h3>
        <h4 style="color: #f56c42;">Difficulty: Moderate; short: seven pages</h4>
        <p>Available: <a target="_blank" href="https://rintintin.colorado.edu/~vancecd/phil215/Hume.pdf">online-pdf</a></p>
        <h4 class="first">About the Author</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;David Hume was a Scottish philosopher most notable for his work concerning the nature and origin of knowledge. Hume was also a historian and economist.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Hume attended the University of Ediburgh at the age of twelve or ten and did not graduate. He spent much of his life writing. He pursued jobs at universities but was discriminated against due to his alleged atheism. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;I am personally obsessed with Hume. I particularly agree with his views on ethics, in that personal ethics is a result of emotion or sentiment rather than a fundamental code.</p>
        <p class="first-paragraph"><b>Influenced by:</b> Macchiavelli, Hobbes, Descartes, Locke, and many others </p>
        <p class="paragraph"><b>Influenced:</b> Kant, Rousseau, Adam Smith, Einstein, and many others </p>
        <h4 class="first">Briefest Summary of the Work</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Short essay about the origin of government and a citizen's obedience to government</p>
        <h4>Major Points</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Hume argues that the concept of government founded solely on consent or agreement is incorrect. He points out that every government in history was founded based on "violence or false pretenses". He does not negate the idea of government founded on consent, but he points out that such a government has not been recorded. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;As regards obedience, Hume states that moral duties may be sorted into two categories. First, the duties which are "natural instinct" and "independent of all ideas of obligation" such as love of children. Second, the duties which are necessary for society to operate such as "regard to the property of others" and "observance of promises." Hume classes obedience to government in the second category. He then asserts that the reason for obedience is that it is necessary for society to operate and not "because we should keep our word." </p>
        <h4 class="myTake">My Take</h4><a name="myTakeOriginalContract"></a>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;As always, Hume applies a degree of nihilism to his subject. In pointing out the lack of historical precedent, he effectively pours cold water on those who suggest government by consent to be the only lawful form of government. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Interestingly he bases his civil-obedience arguments on the notion that he can only "appeal to general opinion" for the correct conclusion. In this subjectivity, he lays himself open to error. He bases his rationale for obedience on what has come before and on general concensus. One cannot expect Hume to imagine the revolutionary American Constitution and the thus far-durable republic it has created. However, by basing what is politically possible on what has come before, Hume reveals a critical flaw in pure empiricism. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;To Hume's credit, he acknowledges his argument as subjective and points out many potential flaws in an original contract which are relevant today. Particularly relevant today is the concept of tacit consent in the face of too few options. Also the notion that citizens may <i>"pay obedience more from fear and necessity, than from any idea of allegiance or of moral obligation."</i> For a seven-page essay, this work contributes a lot, far more than I will record here. </p>

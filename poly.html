        <h4 style="color: #A20;">Difficulty: Hard; short; lots of ancient history and Italian history</h4>

        <h4 class="first">About the Author</h4>
        <div class="first-paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;Machiavelli was a senior official in the small Italian state: the Republic of Florence. He sought the unification of Italy and the expulsion of what he called barbarians: France, The Holy Roman Empire, and the like. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;Machiavelli lived during the late 15th and early 16th centuries in Italy, which is not a pleasant time. Italy is broken into small kingdoms, many owned by foreign empires. The country is flooded with French troops and Spanish mercenaries. The papacy controls a moderate-sized kingdom and engages in power struggles as viciously as anyone else. Handheld firearms are just beginning to play a decisive role in battle.</p>

        <div class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;The most famous political work ever; a history of principalities; instructional booklet for rulers of principalities </div>

        <h4>Major Points</h4>
        <div class="first-paragraph">
          <p class="premise-num">1. </p>
          <p class="premise-text"> One must look at the world as it is, not as it ought to be. </p>

        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="premise-num">2.</p>
          <p class="premise-text"> Princes who lie, manipulate, and are capable of cruelty are more successful than those who rely on loyalty; it is better to be feared than loved.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="premise-num">3.</p>
          <p class="premise-text"> Continual, <i>impetuous</i> activity is key to maintaining a state, not the adherence to a strict moral code. Rulers must act when necessary, in the mode that is necessary, as severely as necessary. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="premise-num">4.</p>
          <p class="premise-text">The reputation of a prince is very important. His actions must be associated with "greatness, spiritedness, gravity and strength" , so that "no one thinks of deceiving or getting around him."</p>
        </div>

        <h4>Selected Additional Points</h4>
        <div class="first-paragraph">If one must commit evil, it is best to do it all at once instead of doling it out over a long period.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">When entering a disparate province, one should ally with lesser powers, weaken the major power, prevent foreign powers from entering, go to live there or build colonies there.

        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">Ministers of a prince are extremely important; ministers ought to think only of the prince, not themselves. Likewise the prince should think often of his ministers.

        <h4 class="myTake">My Take <a name="myTakeThePrince" class="take-anch"></a></h4>
        <div class="first-paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;I would not recommend this book to many people; it is challenging to read and requires a certain, perverse outlook to enjoy. However, it is part of history and is highly influential to subsequent political leaders and scientists. The author's personality is good, not great. His lack of moral pretense is refreshing and sets the stage for empiricism, modern-science, and much good to come. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;<i>The Prince</i> is revolutionary in that Machiavelli does not shy away from the idea that a prince may need to commit atrocities, lie, and break promises; he even intructs the prince on when and how to do so effectively. This lends to the popular notion that Machiavelli is evil. One quote stands out to me:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="quotation">whoever becomes patron of a city accustomed to living free and does not destroy it, should expect to be destroyed by it
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;This is not so much an endorsement of the practice of destroying cities as it is a frank assessment of what one may expect. Looking at history, his assessment is correct. Alexander the Great utterly destroys Thebes, Greece after they revolt against him. This action likely stops Athens and Thebes from rebelling while Alexander conquers Asia. Machiavelli uses the many cities the Romans destroy as his examples, such as Carthage. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;  It is difficult to know what kind of person Machiavelli is, but from <i>The Prince</i> one can see that he is not a sadist; he is instead one with disdain for pretense and the people who act on pretense. </p>

        <h4 class="first">About the Author</h4>
        <div class="first-paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;Hobbes is unique among philosophers as his influential work, <i>Leviathan</i>, does not contain large analogies or premises which have been disproven by chemistry, physics, etc. He was in fact a noted scientist and may have befriended Galileo. He had a contentious, respectful relationship with Descartes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;Hobbes was a beneficiary of the rich Cavendish family. He spent much of his life in England.

        <div class="paragraph"> We owe fealty to the people who provide us sustenance. The mother is the person to whom a child owes fealty to due to providing sustenance. The father is owed fealty only if he sustains the mother. </div>
        <div class="paragraph"> One state subjugating another is invariably a monarchy over the subjugated state i.e. the Roman republic (a type of aristocracy) subjugating its provinces is a republic acting as a monarchy over the provinces; </div>
        <div class="paragraph"> Suggests the argument against monarchy is sophistical: suggesting that subjects of a monarchy are slaves is sophistical</div>

        <h4 class="myTake">My Take <a name="myTakeLeviathan" class="take-anch"></a></h4>
        <div class="first-paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp; The first several chapters of <i>Leviathan</i> contain much more than political philosophy. One sees much of this book in modern-day law, science and cultural norms. In one work, Hobbes lays out much of the heavy lifting for the following centuries. For example, one quote from the book lays out a keen view of the nature of human knowledge: </p>
        </div>
        <div class="quotation">No discourse whatsoever can end in absolute knowledge of fact (...) as for the knowledge of fact, it is originally sense, and ever after memory. (...) it is not absolute, but conditional. No man can know by discourse that this, or that, is, has been, or will be; (...) but only that if this be, that is; if this has been, that has been; if this shall be, that shall be; which is to know conditionally: and that not the consequence of one thing to another, but of one name of a thing to another name of the same thing.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;One who is familiar with Hume's <i>Enquiry</i> may see a troubling similarity between the quoted passage and Hume's division of knowledge into matters of fact and relation between ideas. Nevertheless, Hume's musings are more direct and perhaps more eloquently put. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;In terms of political philosophy, <i>Leviathan</i> is groundbreaking in that it begins the social contract theory. This theory is grounded in the idea that government and society is founded on the notion of a covenant between citizens. From this, all justice and law is developed; where law constitutes an agreement between all citizens. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;The enduring nature of Hobbes's work lies in his definition of "unjust." Justice is in many cases undefined. However, Hobbes provides a simple and consistent method of determing just behavior. Unjust is the breaking of a covenant, all else is just. This remains the foundation of US law. It sometimes creates controversy where no law is broken, but there is a severe ethical incursion, for example, the sub-prime mortgage crisis in 2008. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;Another topic which frequently appears in <i>Leviathan</i> is the notion of authority and trust. Hobbes continually warns: don't trust the "authority of books," don't trust the "authority of an Aristotle," don't trust the "authority and good opinion we have of him that hath said it." He suggests that there is a position below ignorance; he calls it: <i>"as much below the condition of ignorant men as men indued with true science are above it."</i> He is talking about those who believe something false because they gave authority to someone else, those who<i> "follow the blind blindly."</i> I feel that today science has become too complicated and the world too big to give authority to no one. Still, it is a valuable warning. </p>

        <div class="first-paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;David Hume was a Scottish philosopher most notable for his work concerning the nature and origin of knowledge. Hume was also a historian and economist.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;Hume attended the University of Ediburgh at the age of twelve or ten and did not graduate. He spent much of his life writing. He pursued jobs at universities but was discriminated against due to his alleged atheism. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;I am personally obsessed with Hume. I particularly agree with his views on ethics, in that personal ethics is a result of emotion or sentiment rather than a fundamental code.</p>

        <h4 class="first">Briefest Summary of the Work</h4>
        <div class="first-paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;Short essay about the origin of government and a citizen's obedience to government</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Major Points</h4>
        <div class="first-paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;Hume argues that the concept of government founded solely on consent or agreement is incorrect. He points out that every government in history was founded based on "violence or false pretenses". He does not negate the idea of government founded on consent, but he points out that such a government has not been recorded. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;As regards obedience, Hume states that moral duties may be sorted into two categories. First, the duties which are "natural instinct" and "independent of all ideas of obligation" such as love of children. Second, the duties which are necessary for society to operate such as "regard to the property of others" and "observance of promises." Hume classes obedience to government in the second category. He then asserts that the reason for obedience is that it is necessary for society to operate and not "because we should keep our word." </p>
        </div>
        <h4 class="myTake">My Take <a name="myTakeOriginalContract" class="take-anch"></a></h4>
        <div class="first-paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;As always, Hume applies a degree of nihilism to his subject. In pointing out the lack of historical precedent, he effectively pours cold water on those who suggest government by consent to be the only lawful form of government. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;Interestingly he bases his civil-obedience arguments on the notion that he can only "appeal to general opinion" for the correct conclusion. In this subjectivity, he lays himself open to error. He bases his rationale for obedience on what has come before and on general concensus. One cannot expect Hume to imagine the revolutionary American Constitution and the thus far-durable republic it has created. However, by basing what is politically possible on what has come before, Hume reveals a critical flaw in pure empiricism. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text">&emsp; &emsp;To Hume's credit, he acknowledges his argument as subjective and points out many potential flaws in an original contract which are relevant today. Particularly relevant today is the concept of tacit consent in the face of too few options. Also the notion that citizens may <i>"pay obedience more from fear and necessity, than from any idea of allegiance or of moral obligation."</i> For a seven-page essay, this work contributes a lot, far more than I will record here. </p>

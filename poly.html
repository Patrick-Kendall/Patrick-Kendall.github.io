        <h4 class="first">Briefest Summary of the Work</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Renowned as the foundation of political science; a progressive work which broaches psychology, the nature of language, knowledge, and science </p>
        <h4>Major Points</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph"> 1.) Suggests that men are close to equal in physical strength; suggests men are more-closely equal mentally than physically</p>
        <p class="paragraph"> 2.) Suggests "state of nature" where man has no property: you only own what you can hold, and only for as long as you can hold it; below is perhaps the most famous quote from the book: </p>
          <p class="quotation">"the life of man, solitary, poor, brutish, and short" </p>
        <p class="paragraph"> 3.) Suggests the foundation of government is based on agreements </p>
        <p class="paragraph"> 4.) Defines unjust as solely the breaking of a "covenant." Anything which is not the breaking of a covenant is just. </p>
        <p class="paragraph"> 5.) Suggests humans have an inalienable right of self preservation which cannot be given up. through this describes slavery and government
        <p class="paragraph"> 6.) Suggests government has the right to produce truth: regular instruction of the populace as to the truth and standard of law is beneficial to a society </p>
        <p class="paragraph"> 7.) Defines government as three forms: monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy; all other words used to describe government fall within these three forms. One state subjugating another is invariably a monarchy over the subjugated state i.e. the Roman republic (a type of aristocracy) subjugating its provinces is a republic acting as a monarchy over the provinces; </p>
        <h4>Selected Additional Points</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">Defines many words and phrases in the early part of the book which are worth reading: </p>
          <p class="quotation"> "Ignorance of the signification of words; which is, want of understanding, disposeth men to take on trust, not only the truth they know not; but also the errors; and which is more, the nonsense of them they trust." </p>
        <p class="paragraph"> Suggests every serious conversation about the world must begin with clear definitions. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">  Argues that insane people cannot be held to the standard of law because they cannot comprehend the law and therefore cannot agree to it </p>
        <p class="paragraph"> Argues that we owe fealty to the people who provide us sustenance; argues that the mother is the person that a child owes fealty to due to providing sustenance; the father is owed fealty only if he sustains the mother </p>
        <p class="paragraph"> Argues for strong government; likely due to the turmoil in England at the time he lived: the thirty year-long English War of the Roses occurs due to a weak boy monarch and foreign military intervention; the War of the Roses is reportedly what Game of Thrones was based on. </p><a name="myTakeLeviathan"></a>
        <p class="paragraph"> Suggests the argument against monarchy is sophistical: suggesting that subjects of a monarchy are slaves is sophistical</p>
        <h4 class="myTake">My Take</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;The first several chapters of <i>Leviathan</i> contain much more than political philosophy. One sees much of the book in modern-day law, science and cultural norms. In one work, Hobbes lays out much of the heavy lifting for several subjects. For example, one quote from the book lays out a keen view of the nature of human knowledge: </p>
        <p class="quotation">"No discourse whatsoever can end in absolute knowledge of fact (...) as for the knowledge of fact, it is originally sense, and ever after memory. (...) it is not absolute, but conditional. No man can know by discourse that this, or that, is, has been, or will be; (...) but only that if this be, that is; if this has been, that has been; if this shall be, that shall be; which is to know conditionally: and that not the consequence of one thing to another, but of one name of a thing to another name of the same thing."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;One who is familiar with Hume's <i>Treatise</i> may see a troubling similarity between the quoted passage and Hume's division of knowledge into matters of fact and relation between ideas. Nevertheless, Hume's musings are more direct and perhaps more eloquently put. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;An interesting topic which frequently appears in <i>Leviathan</i> is the notion of authority. Hobbes continually warns: don't trust the "authority of books," don't trust the "authority of an Aristotle," don't trust the "authority and good opinion we have of him that hath said it." He suggests that there is a position below ignorance; he calls it: <i>"as much below the condition of ignorant men as men indued with true science are above it."</i> He is talking about those who believe something false because they gave authority to someone else, those who<i> "follow the blind blindly."</i> I feel that today science has become too complicated and the world too big to give authority to no one. Still, it is a valuable warning. </p>

        <p class="myTake-link" style="float:right;"><a href="#myTakeOriginalContract">My Take</a></p>
        <h3 class="author">David Hume (1752)</h3>
        <h4 style="color: #f56c42;">Difficulty: Moderate; short: seven pages</h4>
        <p>Available: <a target="_blank" href="https://rintintin.colorado.edu/~vancecd/phil215/Hume.pdf">online-pdf</a></p>
        <h4 class="first">About the Author</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;David Hume was a Scottish philosopher most notable for his work concerning the nature and origin of knowledge. Hume was also a historian and economist.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Hume attended the University of Ediburgh at the age of twelve or ten and did not graduate. He spent much of his life writing. He pursued jobs at universities but was discriminated against due to his alleged atheism. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;I am personally obsessed with Hume. I particularly agree with his views on ethics, in that personal ethics is a result of emotion or sentiment rather than a fundamental code.</p>
        <p class="first-paragraph"><b>Influenced by:</b> Macchiavelli, Hobbes, Descartes, Locke, and many others </p>
        <p class="paragraph"><b>Influenced:</b> Kant, Rousseau, Adam Smith, Einstein, and many others </p>
        <h4 class="first">Briefest Summary of the Work</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Short essay about the origin of government and a citizen's obedience to government</p>
        <h4>Major Points</h4>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Hume argues that the concept of government founded solely on consent or agreement is incorrect. He points out that every government in history was founded based on "violence or false pretences". He does not negate the idea of government founded on consent, but he points out that such a government has not been recorded. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;As regards obedience, Hume states that moral duties may be sorted into two categories. First, the duties which are "natural instinct" and "independent of all ideas of obligation" such as love of children. Second, the duties which are necessary for society to operate such as "regard to the property of others" and "observance of promises." Hume classes obedience to government in the second category. He then asserts that the reason for obedience is that it is necessary for society to operate and not "because we should keep our word." </p>
        <h4 class="myTake">My Take</h4><a name="myTakeOriginalContract"></a>
        <p class="first-paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;As always, Hume applies a degree of nihilism to his subject. In pointing out the lack of historical precedent, he effectively pours cold water on those who suggest government by consent to be the only lawful form of government. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;Interestingly he bases his civil-obedience arguments on the notion that he can only "appeal to general opinion" for the correct conclusion. In this subjectivity, he lays himself open to error. He bases his rationale for obedience on what has come before and on general concensus. One cannot expect Hume to imagine the revolutionary American Constitution and the thus far-durable republic it has created. However, by basing what is politically possible on what has come before, Hume reveals a critical flaw in pure empiricism. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">&emsp; &emsp;To Hume's credit, he acknowledges his argument as subjective and points out many potential flaws in an original contract which are relevant today. Particularly relevant today is the concept of tacit consent in the face of too few options. Also the notion that citizens may <i>"pay obedience more from fear and necessity, than from any idea of allegiance or of moral obligation."</i> For a seven-page essay, this work contributes a lot, far more than I will record here. </p>

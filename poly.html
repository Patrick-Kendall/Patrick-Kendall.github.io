          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;I would not recommend this book to many people; it is challenging to read and requires a certain, perverse outlook to enjoy. However, it is part of history and is highly influential to subsequent political leaders. The author's personality is good, not great. His lack of moral pretense is refreshing and sets the stage for empiricism, modern-science, and much good to come. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;<i>The Prince</i> is revolutionary in that Machiavelli does not shy away from the idea that a prince may need to commit atrocities, lie, and break promises. He even intructs the prince on when and how to do so effectively. This lends to the popular notion that Machiavelli is evil. One quote stands out:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="quotation">whoever becomes patron of a city accustomed to living free and does not destroy it, should expect to be destroyed by it
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;This is not so much an endorsement of the practice of destroying cities as it is a frank assessment of what one may expect. It is difficult to know what kind of person Machiavelli is, but from <i>The Prince</i> one can see that he is not a sadist; he is instead one with disdain for pretense and those who act on pretense. </p>

          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;Hobbes is a writer and physicist during the 1600's in England and France. He is most notable for his work: <i>Leviathan</i>. This book establishes the social-contract political theory and introduces the concept of inalienable human rights. <i>Leviathan</i> alone defines many western beliefs from Hobbes's time through the present. However, Hobbes is also a noted scientist and may have befriended Galileo, a contemporary of his in Italy. For more on Hobbes, I recommmend the <i> Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</i> <a target="_blank" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hobbes/">here</a>.</p>

        <div class="paragraph"> We owe fealty to the people who provide us sustenance. The mother is the person to whom a child owes fealty. The father is owed fealty only if he sustains the mother. </div>
        <div class="paragraph"> One state subjugating another is invariably a monarchy over the subjugated state, i.e. the Roman republic (a type of aristocracy) subjugating its provinces is a republic acting as a monarchy over the provinces. </div>
        <div class="paragraph"> Suggests the argument against monarchy is sophistical: suggesting that subjects of a monarchy are slaves is sophistical.</div>

        <div class="myTake-header"><p>My Take - Leviathan </p><a name="myTakeLeviathan" class="take-anch"></a></div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;I recommend this book to someone who is looking for a serious study; taking notes or rereading is necessary as this is a dense book. However, at the end you will have gained a lot. There is much more than political philosophy in this book.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp; One sees this in modern-day law, science and cultural norms. In one work, Hobbes lays out much of the heavy lifting for the following centuries. For example, one quote from the book reveals a keen view of the nature of human knowledge: </p>
        </div>
        <div class="quotation">No discourse whatsoever can end in absolute knowledge of fact ... as for the knowledge of fact, it is originally sense, and ever after memory. ... it is not absolute, but conditional. No man can know by discourse that this, or that, is, has been, or will be; ... but only that if this be, that is; if this has been, that has been; if this shall be, that shall be; which is to know conditionally: and that not the consequence of one thing to another, but of one name of a thing to another name of the same thing.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;One who is familiar with Hume's 1748 <i>Enquiry</i> may see a troubling similarity between the quoted passage and Hume's division of knowledge into matters of fact and relation between ideas. Nevertheless, Hume's musings are more direct and perhaps more eloquently put. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;In terms of political philosophy, <i>Leviathan</i> is groundbreaking in that it begins the <i>social-contract theory</i>. This theory is grounded in the idea that government and society is founded by a covenant, or agreement, between citizens. From this, all justice and law is developed; where law constitutes an agreement between all citizens. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;The enduring nature of Hobbes's work lies in his definition of unjust. Justice is in most cases undefined. However, Hobbes provides a simple and consistent method of determining just behavior. Unjust is the breaking of a covenant; all else is just. This remains one pillar of US law. It sometimes creates controversy where no law is broken, but there is a severe ethical incursion. For example, the sub-prime mortgage crisis in 2008. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;Another topic which frequently appears in <i>Leviathan</i> is the notion of authority and trust. Hobbes continually warns: don't trust the "authority of books," don't trust the "authority of an Aristotle," don't trust the "authority and good opinion we have of him that hath said it." He suggests that there is a position below ignorance; he calls it: <i>as much below the condition of ignorant men as men indued with true science are above it.</i> He is talking about those who believe something false because they gave authority to someone else, those who<i> "follow the blind blindly."</i> I feel that today science has become too complicated and the world too big to give authority to no one. Still, it is a valuable warning. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;Hobbes lived during the time of Galileo and Boyle. Europe was engaging in systematic experimental physics for the first time in perhaps over a thousand years. The authority of Aristotle had been good for a long time. Hobbes practiced empiricism; empiricism essentially means one has to see something to believe it. This is interesting in the 1600's when the likes of Galileo may have gone immediately from studying classical science to proving it wrong.  </p>

          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;Rousseau argues that pure democracy is the single valid form of government. He suggests that a representative democracy, such as the U.S., is a form of slavery. In the time between elections, citizens of the U.S. exist in a state of slavery, where voting and executive power are out of their hands. According to Rousseau, real democracy would have periodic meetings between all citizens. Meetings at which laws may be changed. He acknowledges that meetings between all citizens become difficult in the case of multiple-city states.  </p>

          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;The quote, <i>man is born free and everywhere he is in chains,</i> represents an interesting argument made by Rousseau. Critics of Rousseau's logic would point at people living under bad government and claim it disproves his theory. At this time almost all the world lived under feudalism, monarchy or empire. Rousseau suggests his critics are making a base and logically unsound argument. This is best expressed in the quote.  </p>

          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;Henry David Thoreau was a Massachusetts native who advocated living simply with nature. He is perhaps best known for writing <i>Walden</i>. He was a transcendentalist and therefore assigned the highest value to the individual. He expresses anti-government views in <i>Civil Disobedience</i>, but his views are not easily classified in today's political terms. He hated slavery, unjust war, and advocated protecting the environment. </p>

        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;Much of the first pages strike me as disagreeable or outdated. However, parts of this essay are enduring and beautiful. Thoreau is torn between living honestly or tacitly participating in slavery and war. Paying taxes is seen as participating in the actions of government. To avoid participating in evil, one must withdraw from the social-contract government one is born into. Thoreau goes so far as to advocate breaking the law whenever it requires you to do an injustice on another person. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;This is the enduring mandate given in the work. Subsequent civil disobedience has resulted in positive changes across the globe. The problem with Thoreau's justice is that it is fundamentally subjective. For example, one may feel that access to abortion is a civil or human right. However, another may feel that abortion is an "injustice" as defined by Thoreau. If the latter person follows Thoreau's mandate, to disobey the law and even clog the government with their full weight, the government may well grind to a halt. This halting is a consequence of an objection to settled law and a topic which is morally ambiguous, as are all topics. How then does the individual reconcile a sincere difference in conscience between a majority and a minority? </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;One must go back to the Hobbesian notion of judging only by the sword, as was the case for slavery during the Civil War. Thoreau suggests that rule by the majority is simply rule by who is physically the strongest. He points out how law can be and is used to benefit a small group. One quote reveals Thoreau's understanding and contempt for law: </p>
        </div>
        <div class="quotation">The lawyer's truth is not Truth, but consistency, or a consistent expediency. </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;Thoreau seems to believe in capital-t Truth and an objective form of justice; the idea which, for those who desire expediency, is so troubling. However, he points out a real and persistent flaw in democracy: legislators may not represent the people and<i> undue respect for the law</i> can lead to horrific circumstances occurring and continuing. He argues the individual conscience must be allowed to prevail over the rule of law. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;I worry that this book's anti-government propositions may be used out of context to argue for the modern-day anti-government school of thought. Thoreau's sentiments clearly stem from a hatred of the practice of slavery. In context, Thoreau's work is necessary, but out of context it is powerful and ambiguous. He claims that he seeks a reason for paying his taxes every year and cannot justify it. Much of the current movement is not comparable to this, and modern-day motivations may even be abhorrent to Thoreau. His ideas may be used by those who use other people's personalities to justify their own bad or selfish decisions.<p>

            <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;Hume argues that the concept of government founded solely on consent or agreement is incorrect. He points out that every government in history was founded based on "violence or false pretenses". This does not negate the idea of government founded on consent, but he points out that such a government has not been recorded.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="paragraph">
            <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;A sticking point in any conversation about social contracts is how consent is measured. Often, consent is considered tacit or undeclared by the people continuing to live in the country. Hume suggests that in order for tacit consent to exist the people must believe that their consent is required. Tacit consent also suggests that people have an alternative. In Europe, the language barrier and economic risks are insurmountable for the common person. These people have little choice than to continue to live under the government.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="paragraph">
            <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;Living under the government, they need to choose if they will obey the law. Hume sees obedience to the government as a moral question. He states that moral duties may be sorted into two categories. First, the duties which are "natural instinct" and "independent of all ideas of obligation" such as love of children. Second, the duties which are <i>necessary for society to operate</i> such as "regard to the property of others" and "observance of promises." Hume classes obedience to government in the second category. The reason for obedience then is that it is necessary for society to operate and not "because we should keep our word." </p>

          <div class="paragraph">
            <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;As always, Hume applies a degree of nihilism to his subject. In pointing out the lack of historical precedent, he effectively pours cold water on those who suggest government by consent is the only lawful form of government. However, "because we should keep our word" seems like a bad-faith characterization of the reasoning behind original contracts.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="paragraph">
            <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;He bases his arguments on the notion that he can only "appeal to general opinion" for the correct conclusion. In this subjectivity, he lays himself open to error. He bases his criticism on what has come before and on general concensus. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="paragraph">
            <p class="discussion-text"> &emsp;One cannot expect Hume to imagine the revolutionary U.S. Constitution and the dozens of democracies it inspires. However, by basing what is politically possible on what has come before, Hume reveals a critical flaw in pure empiricism. To Hume's credit, he acknowledges his argument as subjective. </p>
